# 20. Bias and Variance: The two big sources of error
->


Suppose your training, dev and test sets all come from the same distribution. Then you should always try to get more training data, since that can only improve performance, right?
->


Even though having more data can’t hurt, unfortunately it doesn’t always help as much as you might hope. It could be a waste of time to work on getting more data. So, how do you decide when to add data, and when not to bother?
->


There are two major sources of error in machine learning: bias and variance. Understanding them will help you decide whether adding data, as well as other tactics to improve performance, are a good use of time.
->


Suppose you hope to build a cat recognizer that has 5% error. Right now, your training set has an error rate of 15%, and your dev set has an error rate of 16%. In this case, adding training data probably won’t help much. You should focus on other changes. Indeed, adding more examples to your training set only makes it harder for your algorithm to do well on the training set. (We explain why in a later chapter.)
->


If your error rate on the training set is 15% (or 85% accuracy), but your target is 5% error (95% accuracy), then the first problem to solve is to improve your algorithm​’​s performance on your training set. Your dev/test set performance is usually worse than your training set performance. So if you are getting 85% accuracy on the examples your algorithm has seen, there’s no way you’re getting 95% accuracy on examples your algorithm hasn’t even seen.
->


Suppose as above that your algorithm has 16% error (84% accuracy) on the dev set. We break the 16% error into two components:
->


* First, the algorithm’s error rate on the training set. In this example, it is 15%. We think of this informally as the algorithm’s **​bias​**.
->


* Second, how much worse the algorithm does on the dev (or test) set than the training set. In this example, it does 1% worse on the dev set than the training set. We think of this informally as the algorithm’s **​variance** [6]
->


Some changes to a learning algorithm can address the first component of error—​**bias​**—and improve its performance on the training set. Some changes address the second component—​**variance​**—and help it generalize better from the training set to the dev/test sets [7]. To select the most promising changes, it is incredibly useful to understand which of these two components of error is more pressing to address.
->


Developing good intuition about Bias and Variance will help you choose effective changes for your algorithm.

-----------------
[6] The field of statistics has more formal definitions of bias and variance that we won’t worry about. Roughly, the bias is the error rate of your algorithm on your training set when you have a very large training set. The variance is how much worse you do on the test set compared to the training set in this setting. When your error metric is mean squared error, you can write down formulas specifying these two quantities, and prove that Total Error = Bias + Variance. But for our purposes of deciding how to make progress on an ML problem, the more informal definition of bias and variance given here will suffice.  

[7] There are also some methods that can simultaneously reduce bias and variance, by making major changes to the system architecture. But these tend to be harder to identify and implement.

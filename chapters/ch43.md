> Your speech system needs more data that sounds as if it were taken from within a car. Rather than collecting a lot of data while driving around, there might be an easier way to get this data: By artificially synthesizing it.

> Suppose you obtain a large quantity of car/road noise audio clips. You can download this data from several websites. Suppose you also have a large training set of people speaking in a quiet room. If you take an audio clip of a person speaking and “add” to that to an audio clip of car/road noise, you will obtain an audio clip that sounds as if that person was speaking in a noisy car. Using this process, you can “synthesize” huge amounts of data that sound as if it were collected inside a car.

> More generally, there are several circumstances where artificial data synthesis allows you to create a huge dataset that reasonably matches the dev set. Let’s use the cat image detector as a second example. You notice that dev set images have much more motion blur because they tend to come from cellphone users who are moving their phone slightly while taking the picture. You can take non-blurry images from the training set of internet images, and add simulated motion blur to them, thus making them more similar to the dev set.

> Keep in mind that artificial data synthesis has its challenges: it is sometimes easier to create synthetic data that appears realistic to a person than it is to create data that appears realistic to a computer. For example, suppose you have 1,000 hours of speech training data, but only 1 hour of car noise. If you repeatedly use the same 1 hour of car noise with different portions from the original 1,000 hours of training data, you will end up with a synthetic dataset where the same car noise is repeated over and over. While a person listening to this audio probably would not be able to tell—all car noise sounds the same to most of us—it is possible that a learning algorithm would “overfit” to the 1 hour of car noise. Thus, it could generalize poorly to a new audio clip where the car noise happens to sound different.

> Alternatively, suppose you have 1,000 unique hours of car noise, but all of it was taken from just 10 different cars. In this case, it is possible for an algorithm to “overfit” to these 10 cars and perform poorly if tested on audio from a different car. Unfortunately, these problems can be hard to spot.

> To take one more example, suppose you are building a computer vision system to recognize cars. Suppose you partner with a video gaming company, which has computer graphics models of several cars. To train your algorithm, you use the models to generate synthetic images of cars. Even if the synthesized images look very realistic, this approach (which has been independently proposed by many people) will probably not work well. The video game might have ~20 car designs in the entire video game. It is very expensive to build a 3D car model of a car; if you were playing the game, you probably wouldn’t notice that you’re seeing the same cars over and over, perhaps only painted differently. I.e., this data looks very realistic to you. But compared to the set of all cars out on roads—and therefore what you’re likely to see in the dev/test sets—this set of 20 synthesized cars captures only a minuscule fraction of the world’s distribution of cars. Thus if your 100,000 training examples all come from these 20 cars, your system will “overfit” to these 20 specific car designs, and it will fail to generalize well to dev/test sets that include other car designs.

> When synthesizing data, put some thought into whether you’re really synthesizing a representative set of examples. Try to avoid giving the synthesized data properties that makes it possible for a learning algorithm to distinguish synthesized from non-synthesized examples—such as if all the synthesized data comes from one of 20 car designs, or all the synthesized audio comes from only 1 hour of car noise. This advice can be hard to follow.

> When working on data synthesis, my teams have sometimes taken weeks before we produced data with details that are close enough to the actual distribution for the synthesized data to have a significant effect. But if you are able to get the details right, you can suddenly access a far larger training set than before.

# 26. Error analysis on the training set
->

Your algorithm must perform well on the training set before you can expect it to perform well on the dev/test sets.
->

In addition to the techniques described earlier to address high bias, I sometimes also carry out an error analysis on the ​*training data*,​ following a protocol similar to error analysis on the Eyeball dev set. This can be useful if your algorithm has high bias—i.e., if it is not fitting the training set well.
->

For example, suppose you are building a speech recognition system for an app and have collected a training set of audio clips from volunteers. If your system is not doing well on the training set, you might consider listening to a set of ~100 examples that the algorithm is doing poorly on to understand the major categories of training set errors. Similar to the dev set error analysis, you can count the errors in different categories:
->

| Audio clip  | Loud background noise | User spoke quickly | Far from microphone |   Comments |
| ----------: | :-------------------: | :----------------: | :-----------------: |  :-------: |
| 1           |         x             |                    |                     | Car noise |
| 2           |         x             |                    |          x          | Restaurant noise |
| 3           |                       |       x            |          x          | User shouting across living room? |
| 4           |         x             |                    |                     | Coffeeshop |
| % of total  |        75%            |      25%           |         50%         |

In this example, you might realize that your algorithm is having a particularly hard time with training examples that have a lot of background noise. Thus, you might focus on techniques that allow it to better fit training examples with background noise.
->

You might also double-check whether it is possible for a person to transcribe these audio clips, given the same input audio as your learning algorithm. If there is so much background noise that it is simply impossible for anyone to make out what was said, then it might be unreasonable to expect any algorithm to correctly recognize such utterances. We will discuss the benefits of comparing your algorithm to human-level performance in a later section.

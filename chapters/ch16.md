# 16. Cleaning up mislabeled dev and test set examples
->


During error analysis, you might notice that some examples in your dev set are mislabeled. When I say “mislabeled” here, I mean that the pictures were already mislabeled by a human labeler even before the algorithm encountered it. I.e., the class label in an example ​(x,y)​ has an incorrect value for ​y.​ For example, perhaps some pictures that are not cats are mislabeled as containing a cat, and vice versa. If you suspect the fraction of mislabeled images is significant, add a category to keep track of the fraction of examples mislabeled:

Should you correct the labels in your dev set? Remember that the goal of the dev set is to help you quickly evaluate algorithms so that you can tell if Algorithm A or B is better. If the fraction of the dev set that is mislabeled impedes your ability to make these judgments, then it is worth spending time to fix the mislabeled dev set labels.

For example, suppose your classifier’s performance is:
->


* Overall accuracy on dev set.................... 90% (10% overall error.)
->


* Errors due to mislabeled examples....... 0.6% (6% of dev set errors.)
->


* Errors due to other causes..................... 9.4% (94% of dev set errors)
->


Here, the 0.6% inaccuracy due to mislabeling might not be significant enough relative to the 9.4% of errors you could be improving. There is no harm in manually fixing the mislabeled images in the dev set, but it is not crucial to do so: It might be fine not knowing whether your system has 10% or 9.4% overall error.

Suppose you keep improving the cat classifier and reach the following performance:
->


* Overall accuracy on dev set.................... 98.0% (2.0% overall error.)
->


* Errors due to mislabeled examples....... 0.6%. (30% of dev set errors.)
->


* Errors due to other causes..................... 1.4% (70% of dev set errors)
->


30% of your errors are due to the mislabeled dev set images, adding significant error to your estimates of accuracy. It is now worthwhile to improve the quality of the labels in the dev set. Tackling the mislabeled examples will help you figure out if a classifier’s error is closer to 1.4% or 2%—a significant relative difference.
->


It is not uncommon to start off tolerating some mislabeled dev/test set examples, only later to change your mind as your system improves so that the fraction of mislabeled examples grows relative to the total set of errors.
->


The last chapter explained how you can improve error categories such as Dog, Great Cat and Blurry through algorithmic improvements. You have learned in this chapter that you can work on the Mislabeled category as well—through improving the data’s labels.
->


Whatever process you apply to fixing dev set labels, remember to apply it to the test set labels too so that your dev and test sets continue to be drawn from the same distribution. Fixing your dev and test sets together would prevent the problem we discussed in Chapter 6, where your team optimizes for dev set performance only to realize later that they are being judged on a different criterion based on a different test set.
->


If you decide to improve the label quality, consider double-checking both the labels of examples that your system misclassified as well as labels of examples it correctly classified. It is possible that both the original label and your learning algorithm were wrong on an example. If you fix only the labels of examples that your system had misclassified, you might introduce bias into your evaluation. If you have 1,000 dev set examples, and if your classifier has 98.0% accuracy, it is easier to examine the 20 examples it misclassified than to examine all 980 examples classified correctly. Because it is easier in practice to check only the misclassified examples, bias does creep into some dev sets. This bias is acceptable if you are interested only in developing a product or application, but it would be a problem if you plan to use the result in an academic research paper or need a completely unbiased measure of test set accuracy.

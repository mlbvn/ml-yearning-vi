> Users of your cat pictures app have uploaded 10,000 images, which you have manually labeled as containing cats or not. You also have a larger set of 200,000 images that you downloaded off the internet. How should you define train/dev/test sets?

> Since the 10,000 user images closely reflect the actual probability distribution of data you want to do well on, you might use that for your dev and test sets. If you are training a data-hungry deep learning algorithm, you might give it the additional 200,000 internet images for training. Thus, your training and dev/test sets come from different probability distributions. How does this affect your work?

> Instead of partitioning our data into train/dev/test sets, we could take all 210,000 images we have, and randomly shuffle them into train/dev/test sets. In this case, all the data comes from the same distribution. But I recommend against this method, because about 205,000/210,000 ≈ 97.6% of your dev/test data would come from internet images, which does not reflect the actual distribution you want to do well on. Remember our recommendation on choosing dev/test sets:

> Most of the academic literature on machine learning assumes that the training set, dev set and test set all come from the same distribution [11]. In the early days of machine learning, data was scarce. We usually only had one dataset drawn from some probability distribution. So we would randomly split that data into train/dev/test sets, and the assumption that all the data was coming from the same source was usually satisfied.

> But in the era of big data, we now have access to huge training sets, such as cat internet images. Even if the training set comes from a different distribution than the dev/test set, we still want to use it for learning since it can provide a lot of information.

> For the cat detector example, instead of putting all 10,000 user-uploaded images into the dev/test sets, we might instead put 5,000 into the dev/test sets. We can put the remaining 5,000 user-uploaded examples into the training set. This way, your training set of 205,000 examples contains some data that comes from your dev/test distribution along with the 200,000 internet images. We will discuss in a later chapter why this method is helpful.

> Let’s consider a second example. Suppose you are building a speech recognition system to transcribe street addresses for a voice-controlled mobile map/navigation app. You have 20,000 examples of users speaking street addresses. But you also have 500,000 examples of other audio clips with users speaking about other topics. You might take 10,000 examples of street addresses for the dev/test sets, and use the remaining 10,000, plus the additional 500,000 examples, for training.

> We will continue to assume that your dev data and your test data come from the same distribution. But it is important to understand that different training and dev/test distributions offer some special challenges.

> **FOOTNOTE:**

> [11] There is some academic research on training and testing on different distributions. Examples include “domain adaptation,” “transfer learning” and “multitask learning.” But there is still a huge gap between theory and practice. If you train on dataset A and test on some very different type of data B, luck could have a huge effect on how well your algorithm performs. (Here, “luck” includes the researcher’s hand-designed features for the particular task, as well as other factors that we just don’t understand yet.) This makes the academic study of training and testing on different distributions difficult to carry out in a systematic way.

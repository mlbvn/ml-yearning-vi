> Suppose you are building a speech recognition system. Your system works by inputting an audio clip ​*A*,​ and computing some Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*) for each possible output sentence ​*S​*. For example, you might try to estimate Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*) = P(​*S​*|​*A​*), the probability that the correct output transcription is the sentence ​*S*,​ given that the input audio was *​A*.

> Given a way to compute Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*), you still have to find the English sentence ​*S* that maximizes it:

> So, you need to apply an approximate search algorithm, to try to find the value of ​*S* that

(For the purposes of this chapter, you don’t need to understand the details of beam search.) Algorithms like this are not guaranteed to find the value of ​*S* ​that maximizes Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*).

> Suppose that an audio clip ​*A​* records someone saying “I love machine learning.” But instead of outputting the correct transcription, your system outputs the incorrect “I love robots.” There are now two possibilities for what went wrong:

> 1. **Search algorithm problem​**. The approximate search algorithm (beam search) failed to find the value of ​*S​* that maximizes Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*).

> 2. **Objective (scoring function) problem.**​ Our estimates for Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*) = P(​*S​*|​*A​*) were inaccurate. In particular, our choice of Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*) failed to recognize that “I love machine learning” is the correct transcription.

> Facing this situation, some researchers will randomly decide to work on the search algorithm; others will randomly work on a better way to learn values for Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*). But unless you know which of these is the underlying cause of the error, your efforts could be

> Let S​<sub>out</sub> be the output transcription (“I love robots”). Let S<sup>x</sup> be the correct transcription (“I love machine learning”). In order to understand whether #1 or #2 above is the problem, you can perform the ​**Optimization Verification test​**: First, compute Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*<sup>x</sup>) and Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*<sub>out</sub>). Then check whether Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*<sup>x</sup>) > Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*<sub>out</sub>). There are two possibilities:

-> _start your translation RIGHT AFTER this line_

> Case 1: Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*<sup>x</sup>) > Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*<sub>out</sub>)

-> _start your translation RIGHT AFTER this line_

> In this case, your learning algorithm has correctly given S<sup>x</sup> a higher score than S​<sub>out</sub>.​ Nevertheless, our approximate search algorithm chose S​<sub>out</sub> rather than S<sup>x</sup>. This tells you that out ​your approximate search algorithm is failing to choose the value of S that maximizes Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*). In this case, the Optimization Verification test tells you that you have a search algorithm problem and should focus on that. For example, you could try increasing the beam width of beam search.

> Case 2: Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*<sup>x</sup>) ≤ Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*<sub>out</sub>)

-> _start your translation RIGHT AFTER this line_

> In this case, you know that the way you’re computing Score​<sub>A​</sub>(.) is at fault: It is failing to give a strictly higher score to the correct output ​*S*<sup>x</sup> than the incorrect ​S​<sub>out</sub>. The Optimization Verification test tells you that you have an objective (scoring) function problem. Thus, you should focus on improving how you learn or approximate Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*) for different sentences ​*S​*.

> Our discussion has focused on a single example. To apply the Optimization Verification test in practice, you should examine the errors in your dev set. For each error, you would test whether Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*<sup>x</sup>) > Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​*S*<sub>out</sub>). Each dev example for which this inequality holds will get A​ A​ out​ marked as an error caused by the optimization algorithm. Each example for which this does not hold (Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​S<sup>x</sup>) ≤ Score​<sub>A​</sub>(​S<sub>out</sub>)) gets counted as a mistake due to the way you’re computing Score​<sub>A​</sub>(.).
